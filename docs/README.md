# COMP 3504 - Tool Inventory Management System

## Project Details
This is a school group project made with the intention of practicing the SCRUM methodology

## Overview

This project is a simple inventory management system for a retail shop that sells tools. The program allows the store owner to:

- Add and delete tools from the inventory.
- Search for tools by tool nameor tool ID.
- Automatically generate order lines when the quantity of a tool falls below a specified threshold.

The project is divided into two 1-week sprints, following agile best practices. The development is done collaboratively using GitHub for version control.

## Programming Language

The application is implemented in Python.


## Features
1. **Add and Delete Tools**: The owner can add new tools to the inventory or delete them.
2. **Search for Tools**: Tools can be searched by name or ID.
3. **Inventory Management**: The system checks if the quantity of an item falls below 10. If so, it automatically generates an order.
4. **Order Generation**: Orders are written to orders.txt and include tool details, supplier information, and total costs.
5. **Data Storage**: Tool information is read from items.txt, and supplier information is read from suppliers.txt.

## Files
- **main.py**: Contains the code for the program.
- **items.txt**: Contains information on tools, including ID, name, quantity, price, and supplier ID.
- **suppliers.txt**: Stores supplier details such as ID, company name, address, and salesperson contact.
- **orders.txt**: Stores order details when inventory falls below the threshold.

## Usage
1. **Launch the Program**
   - Run **'main.py'** file to start the program.

       3. **Exit**: Closes the program.
